"Million Dollar Beast" is a trading strategy developed by rubicon to help you stay on track. It is based on the philosophy of compounding interest. 
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>"Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it... earns it; he who doesn't... pays it." ~ Albert Einstein</blockquote>

This simple automated spreadsheet will help track trades and show you in comparisson of the required trades to make a Million Dollars at 10% per trade. You don't have to feel compelled to trade every day or do 10% on any day or start with 10 or 10,000 dollars. It can be totally customized but is based off a multiple of 10. To change from a starting point of $100 to $1,000, just edit the A1 cell on the 'CALCULATIONS' tab. Everything will be recalculated automatically.
